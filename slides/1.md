## What is Svelte?

Svelte is a frontend framework for webdev with a number of advantages:

* It compiles down to vanilla JS on the server-side
* ...and so is ~30% faster (and much smaller) than e.g. Vue.js
* It's very nicely componentized

## What is Flask?

Flask is a small backend framework based in Python.

## What's the problem?

The Svelte docs assume you're using Node (or Sapper) for the backend, so (at least for me!) it isn't immediately obvious how to serve a Svelte app from Flask.

## What's the solution?

I'll show you!
